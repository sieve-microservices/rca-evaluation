### [data]
###
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is

### [hinted-handoff]

###
### Controls non-Raft cluster behavior, which generally includes how data is

### [shard-precreation]
###
### Controls the precreation of shards, so they are available before data arrives.

### or partially in the past.

###
### Controls the system self-monitoring, statistics and diagnostics.
###
### The internal database for monitoring data is created automatically if
### if it does not already exist. The target retention within this database
### is called 'monitor' and is also created with a retention period of 7 days
### and a replication factor of 1, if it does not exist. In all cases the
### this retention policy is configured as the default for the database.
